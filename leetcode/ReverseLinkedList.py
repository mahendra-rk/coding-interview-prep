#206. Reverse Linked List

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:

        previous = None
        current = head        
        while current:
            temp = current.next # store reference to later elements in temp
            current.next = previous # update the .next with previous element. first value will be None as the tail of LL is None.
            previous = current # current element becomes the previous element for the next element in the LL
            current = temp # get back the reference to the remaining elements. 
        return previous
